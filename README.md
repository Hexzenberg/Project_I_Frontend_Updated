# Project I Frontend Repository.

#### This is the Frontend part of the project I made for my University final year. 
#### Made in React.
#### Fetches the news from the local api and then does the pagination of the articles and displays the news articles with the fetched sentiment in same sized 'news cards'.
#### Added recommendation for articles also reduced the number of articles that were to be displayed.
#### Added Login/Register Priviledges by using firebase.
